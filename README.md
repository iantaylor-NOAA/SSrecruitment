## Draft Outline (in development)

* Stock-recruitment relationships
  * Beverton-Holt
  * Shepherd
  * Low Fecundity Stock Recruit
* Recruitment deviations
  * SigmaR
  * Eras: Init/Early, Main, Late/Forecast
  * Bias adjustment
* Settlement events
* Apportionment of recruitment (to multiple areas, growth patterns, or settlement events)
* Time-varying stock-recruit relationships (regimes)
  * Initial year vs. equilibrium (R1 in 3.24)
  * Environmental links
  * Forecasting with high or low recruitments
* Autocorrelation and impact on forecast (see Johnson et al. 2017)
* Recruitment and model uncertainty in Bayesian vs. MLE estimates
* Simulating with random recruitment
* Recap of changes from 3.24 to 3.30 (also mentioned throughout)
* Ideas for the future:
  * Area-specific spawning biomass
  * Density-dependent recruitment variability
  * Semi-parametric stock-recruit curve
